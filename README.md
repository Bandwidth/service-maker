# service-maker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/inetCatapult/service-maker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/inetCatapult/service-maker)

## Overview 
Service Maker makes interacting with AWS easier. It does this by providing a set of sane defaults by which news AWS instances are created, so rather than specifying each individual setting required to spin up a new instance, all you have to do is tell Service Maker the important stuff. It takes care of the rest.

## Installation
Clone the repo and type `npm install`. That's it. 

## Usage
Service Maker provides a command-line endpoint for user access. A more detailed list of functionality can be reached by typing `smake --help`.
